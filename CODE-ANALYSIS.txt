ANALYSIS README
===============

1. Introduction
---------------

  The code can be analysed using Gradle's built in plugin support for a number of static analysers.
  Gradle provides a way to wrap an ant build file, making the solution suitable for deploying alongside Mibble
  without having to modify any of its existing build files.


2. Gradle Installation
----------------------
   Gradle requires a Java JDK or JRE to be installed, version 6 or higher (to check, use java -version).
   Gradle ships with its own Groovy library, therefore Groovy does not need to be installed.
   Any existing Groovy installation is ignored by Gradle.

   Gradle uses whatever JDK it finds in your path. Alternatively, you can set the JAVA_HOME environment variable
   to point to the installation directory of the desired JDK.

   Instructions for installing Gradle can be found here https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html


3. Code Analysis
----------------
   Once Gradle is installed and configured correctly, the analysis can be executed by running the following command
   in the project's directory.

       $ gradle build

   This will execute the analysis plugins and write the output to the build/reports directory for each plugin.
   For example:

       ➜  mibble git:(master) ✗ gradle build
       :clean
       :compileJava
       :processResources UP-TO-DATE
       :classes
       :jar
       :assemble
       :findbugsMain
       FindBugs rule violations were found. See the report at: build/reports/findbugs/main.html
       :pmdMain
       23 PMD rule violations were found. See the report at: build/reports/pmd/main.html
       :compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE
       :processTestResources UP-TO-DATE
       :testClasses UP-TO-DATE
       :test UP-TO-DATE
       :check
       :build

       BUILD SUCCESSFUL

       Total time: 30.606 secs
