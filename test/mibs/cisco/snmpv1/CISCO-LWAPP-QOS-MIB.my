--    
--    The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
--    the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
--    the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.
--    
--    LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
--    controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
--    that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
--    The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
--    wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
--    the LWAPP frames to the controller.
--    
--                       GLOSSARY
--    
--    Access Point ( AP )
--    
--    An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
--    control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
--    and provides access to the distribution services via
--    the wireless medium for associated clients.  
--    
--    LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
--    LWAPP frames and sends them to the controller to which
--    it is logically connected.
--    
--    Gratuitous Probe Response (GPR)
--    
--    The Gratuitous Probe Response feature aids in conserving
--    battery power of WLAN-enabled cell phones by providing
--    a high rate packet on the order of tens of milliseconds
--    such that these kind of phones can wake up and wait at
--    predefined intervals, to reduce battery power.  The 
--    GPR packet is transmitted from the AP at a predefined
--    time interval.
--     
--    
--    Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP )
--    
--    This is a generic protocol that defines the 
--    communication between the Access Points and the
--    Central Controller. 
--    
--    Mobile Node ( MN )
--    
--    A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
--    network associated with an access point. Mobile Node 
--    and client are used interchangeably. 
--    
--    TU
