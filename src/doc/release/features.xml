        <title>Bundled IANA and IETF MIB files</title>
        <text>All the standard IANA and IETF MIB files are

        parsing.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Proper import &amp; symbol handling</title>
        <text>Each referenced module is imported either from
        the bundled MIB files or from an externally supplied
        source (filesystem or URL). Symbols can also be
        prefixed with their module names to avoid possible
        naming conflicts.</text>
      </item>

      <item>
        <title>Access to all MIB information, text and comments</title>
        <text>All the type and value information from the MIB files
        are available to an application through public methods in
        the library object model. Also available is the full MIB
        text and all comments connected to each symbol.</text>

      <item>
        <title>Detailed and precise error messages</title>

        file.</text>

        <title>Commercial license available for proprietary software</title>
