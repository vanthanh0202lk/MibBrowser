MIBBLE README
=============

1. Introduction
---------------

Mibble is an open-source SNMP MIB (or SMI) parser library for Java.
It reads MIB files (in ASN.1 syntax) and provides an API to access
all the information, including OIDs, types, descriptions, comments
and the original MIB source text.

Mibble comes bundled with a comprehensive set standard IANA and
IETF MIBs, command-line apps for formatting and validation, and a
graphical MIB browser with a simple SNMP manager.
